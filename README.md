# Simple-Calculator-using-HTML-CSS-JS
I have created a project a simple web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Its a simple calculator which is modulated from the genral programs, like the ones having the functions usage where for each operation the respective function will be called. But to make it as an withUI application, I used html's container class, which lets us use have buttons in the UI. I did some styling using css. As I said, not a genral function usage, I also added some things which gets the concept of event handling(As in, I created events which will trigger respective of the button clicks). Happy coding!!
